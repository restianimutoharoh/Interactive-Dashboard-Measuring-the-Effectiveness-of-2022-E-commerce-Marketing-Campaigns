# Interactive Dashboard: Measuring the Effectiveness of 2022 E-commerce Marketing Campaigns

## Summary

### *E-commerce Financial Performance Analysis 2022: Sales, Profit, and AOV Metrics*

### Insight 

* **Consistent Sales Peaks:** Sales consistently peak in late summer (August-September) but suffer a sharp, unseasonal decline towards the end of the year.
* **Product Dominance:** The "Mobiles & Tablets" category, led by brands like Samsung and Apple, is the primary revenue driver, but its high performance doesn't prevent a significant year-end slump.
* **AOV Spikes:** Sharp increases in Average Order Value (AOV) in April and September indicate periods of high-value purchasing, suggesting successful targeted promotions or product launches during those times.
* **Payment Preference:**  Customers overwhelmingly prefer Cash on Delivery (COD), indicating a potential lack of trust in digital payments or a preference for offline transactions.


### Recommendations 

* **Reinforce Peak Season Strategy:** Capitalize on the predictable August-September peak with aggressive promotions and ensure ample stock of top-selling products.
* **Mitigate Year-End Slump:** Investigate the causes of the post-September sales decline and implement targeted marketing campaigns to boost Q4 performance.
* **Promote Digital Payments:** Offer incentives (e.g., discounts, free shipping) and improve security guarantees to encourage customers to adopt digital payment methods.
* **Replicate AOV Success:** Analyze the products and strategies behind the AOV spikes in April and September to replicate that success and increase order value in other months.


### *Main Dashboard: 2022 Annual E-commerce Performance Overview* 

### Insight

* **Significant COD Preference:** The most popular payment method is Cash on Delivery (COD), with 1,809 unique orders in 2022, far exceeding any other payment option. This indicates a strong customer preference for offline payments.

### Recommendations 

* **Leverage Top Categories:** Focus marketing and promotional efforts on the "Mobiles & Tablets" category and top-selling brands like Samsung and Apple to maintain their market dominance.
* **Encourage Digital Payments:** Offer incentives, such as discounts or free shipping, to encourage customers to switch from COD to digital payment methods. This could improve operational efficiency and reduce logistical risks.
* **Optimize High-Value Products:** Analyze the top-selling products to understand what drives their success. Replicate these strategies to boost sales of other products and increase the overall average order value.
* **Invest in Growing Segments:** Develop specific strategies for categories that are showing growth, such as "Books," to diversify the product portfolio and reduce reliance on a few key categories.
